&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6-Week Courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to run further 6-week courses from May 2025. These will likely be a Wednesday or Friday evening from 6-8PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining a 6 week course means you get access to a One for All Forest School learning journal where you can keep notes about the skills you’ve learned, have space to journal or make art, store resources provided during the course, and set and track goals across the 6 holistic domains of learning (physical, intellectual, emotional, communication, spriitual, and social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a variety of activities on offer each week depending on what you as participants say you’re interested in. We almost always have a fire and tea as well as books, hammocks, and some kind of art or craft. Examples of other activities we have offered include knot tying, natural rope making, whittling, apple pressing, outdoor cooking, and foraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; This year (summer 2024), we offered 12 spaces per course at £5 per session. We ask that this is paid up front for the block of 8 sessions as a one off payment £30 for the 6-week summer evening sessions. If you think you may struggle to pay this amount up front please get in touch as we will do our best to work out a plan that works for you. We were able to offer 2 concessionary spaces at half cost this year. Please get in touch if you feel this would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One for All Forest School Workshops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are full for our Monday Evening sessions and as these are now underway, we are unable to take on participants for this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From September 2024, we are running Forest School taster workshops across the city. Please keep a look out for the dates on social media or contact us if you would like us to keep you updated. Our hope is that by accessing Forest School workshops, you will feel curious and excited about joining future 6-week courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At One for All Forest School’s Workshops you will have opportunities to learn bush craft skills, experience a therapeutic environment that facilitates connection with yourself, others and nature, enjoy multiple nature activity spaces, and relax around the fire with tea. We encourage participants to participate in activities as much or as little as they feel able. Some participants enjoy quiet time in the hammocks or under tarp shelter while others enjoy learning bush craft skills or making crafts, and many enjoy socializing around the fire. There is no pressure to engage with everything on offer and the focus is on participants choosing what activity feels right for them at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location of workshops will vary by month. We aim to host workshops across the city so that we can reach as many communities as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

We offer sliding scale options in an attempt to make sessions accessible for everyone. The lowest end of the sliding scale is £5 and the upper end (depending on the workshop) would likely be £15 or £20. We will always tell you the cost of materials so that you can make an informed decision about what you are paying for. Of course, we are always happy to accept donations at your discretion. We are a community interest company which means that any additional donations goes right back into the company and making this as affordable and accessible for everyone as possible. The feedback that we have had from participants is that the value for money is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://oneforallforestschool.org//project-2</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://oneforallforestschool.org//">&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-forest-school&quot;&gt;What is Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest School is a learner-centred inspirational learning process, that offers opportunities for holistic growth through regular sessions. It is a long-term program that supports play, exploration and supported risk taking. It develops confidence and self-esteem through learner inspired, hands-on experiences in a natural setting. - Forest School Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-6-principles-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the 6 Principles of Forest SChool?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Forest School is a long-term process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Forest School takes place in a natural wooded environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Forest School aims to promote holistic development&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Forest School offers learners the opportunity to take supported risks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.Forest School is run by qualified Forest School practitioners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.Forest School uses a range of learner-centred processes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Forest School Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-makes-one-for-all-forest-school-different&quot;&gt;What makes One for All Forest School different?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One for All Forest School is currently only for adults (18+). We focus on making an inclusive environment for people with neurodivergent conditions such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, CPTSD, Tourette’s Syndrome, personality disorders, etc. We pay particular attention to supporting participants with sensory, social, and emotional regulation differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-are-the-forest-school-facilitaors&quot;&gt;Who are the Forest School facilitaors?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah uses she/her pronouns. I am the founder and director of One for All. I am a qualified forest school leader and teacher. I also have experience as a disability social worker and as a family therapist. I have diagnosed ADHD and undiagnosed Autism. I am so excited to share the therapeutic benefits of being outdoors with you and the wonder of “play”. My favourite tree is an oak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kira uses she/her pronouns. I grew up in the Sussex countryside and have always felt a deep connection to nature and the outdoors. I joined One for All to help with the business side of things and now am excited to help run sessions and use my love of nature to help people reconnect with our planet and the outoodrs. My favourite flower is jasmine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-i-do-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What would I do at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Forest School there is a focus on learning through play (whatever that means to you). You might want to cook, craft something, go on a nature walk, journal, meditate, use tools, sit around the fire, tell stories, make a shelter or den, use your imagination, learn bushcraft skills, draw something, socialize, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-i-wear-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What do I wear at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That depends on the weather. If it’s sunny you should bring a hat and suncream. If it’s rainy/wet you should bring waterproof clothing and boots. In the winter make sure to wear lots of layers as well as waterproofs. Don’t wear wellies in the winter - they’re not warm enough. Throughout the year you should wear comfortable clothing and close-toed shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-if-theres-bad-weather&quot;&gt;What if there’s bad weather?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest School usually runs rain or shine. If it’s cold, we might do an activity to warm up or gather around the fire. If it’s raining, we will put up tarps to shelter under or enjoy some games in the rain! Likewise, if it’s very warm and sunny we will find areas of shade to cool off. This is why it’s important to be properly dressed for Forest School. We do not have sessions if it’s very windy or if there’s threats of lightening, though. That wound’t be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-do-we-have-forest-school&quot;&gt;Where do we have Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had sessions at a few differnt sites. We were first welcomed at Moulsecoomb Place which is a nice open area off Lewes Road. We found a home at Hodshrove Woods deep in the middle of Moulsecoomb. We have also explored Bevendean Woods near the allotments as a potential site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-is-learning-assessed&quot;&gt;How is learning assessed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At it’s heart, Forest School is learner-led. We work collaborativly with you to set goals and track your development across 6 holistic domains: social, phsyical, intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and communcation. We will provide you with a “Learning Journal” with prompts, activities, and self-assessments that you can chose from to track your learning and growth. As leaders, we will provide you with supportive and constructive feedback too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-long-is-a-forest-school-session&quot;&gt;How long is a Forest School session?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest School is a long-term programme so we ask that you try to commit to coming once a week for the 8 block of sessions. Sessions last 2 hours. The schedule for the sessions is fairly loose, but we try to start with Circle Time to welcome you and talk about any safety procedures, followed by free play time, and finally Together Time at the end to reflect and share together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-our-senses&quot;&gt;Using our Senses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-might-i-see-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What might I see at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see lots of different things in the Forest School setting. You might see the different types of trees we have on site such as ash, hawthorne, and sycamore. Depending on the season you might see differnt types of creatures such as butterflies, birds, or squirrels. You might want to stand back and look at the site as a whole or get up close with a magnifying glass and study details. It’s all about perspective!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-might-i-hear-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What might I hear at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably hear people chatting as they walk by and depending on the site, cars and buses as the drive by. But don’t let that distract you from the sounds of nature. If you listen, you’ll hear birds chirping, the breeze as it rustles the trees, and the crackling fire. You may even be able to identify the birds and other creatures you’ll hear. Storytelling is an important feature in Forest School so you might hear stories or songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-might-i-feel-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What might I feel at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might feel the sun or the rain. You might feel warm or cold. You might feel “just right”. You might feel the grass underfoot or the breeze on your face. There’s lots of textures of differnt plants, materials, and creatures you might choose to explore. You might like that deep pressure and want to hug a tree or  You might like other sensations and want to swing in the hammock. There’s something for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-might-i-taste-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What might I taste at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re doing a cooking session, you’ll taste some wonderful things at Forest School!  We might have some popcorn over the fire or some fruit for a snack. We might go on a little forage and use some of our harvest to make a snack. We have a general rule though - no pick-y, no lick-y. So unless you show the foraged goodie to at least 2 others who can confirm it’s edible, it’s best to primiarily use our other sesnses in Forest School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-might-i-smell-at-forest-school&quot;&gt;What might I smell at Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the season, you might smell a variety of things. In the spring and summer you might smell flowering plants. In the autumn, you might be able to smell the change in the air as it cools down. You might even smell the rain. Did you know humans have a very good smell for rain? We can smell the bacteria in the soil that’s activated after rainfall. This was likely a benefit for our ancestors who could smell good, rich soil for farmable land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-holistic-domains-of-learning&quot;&gt;6 Holistic Domains of Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-physical-benefits-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the physical benefits of Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with tools and crafts in Forest School develops motor skills and  coordination. Many activities in Forest School also promote physical wellbeing and help us develop our self-care skills. There is evidence to suggest that nature is a sensory regulating environment, and throughout the Forest School sessions you will be encouraged and supported to understand your sensory needs and preferences and activities that make you feel good in yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-mental-benefits-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the mental benefits of Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Forest School, we understand the benefits of risk-taking and support you with calculating risks and developing your critical thinking skills. The activities you engage in will require you to build your concentration and perseverance which can be tricky things to develop in an age of instant gratification.  These activities will also stimulate your creativity and imagination as well as deepen your knowledge of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-emotional-benefits-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the emotional benefits of Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activities and games you engage with in Forest School will help build your confidence, resilience, and ability to problem solve and cope with challenges. As we experiment and play, things might not always go the way we expect. Forest School gives us a safe and supportive place (in a naturally regulating environment) to explore those challenges and develop ways to emotionally regulate when things don’t go to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-social-benefits-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the social benefits of Forest SChool?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games and activities in Forest SChool give us opportunites to interact and socialize with each other. Participation and involvement can look different, depending on the person, but througout the sessions you will be building relationships with each other and with the Leaders. Part of the therapeutic nature of Forest SChool is the richness of those relationships, which is why we keep ratios and groups small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-spiritual-benefits-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the spiritual benefits of Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spiritual” means different things to different people. In forest school, we like to think of it as a sense of awe, wonder, and connection to nature. We might also think of within the context of our morals, values, and ethics. In Forest School, we think of “play” as a spiritual practice. “Play” is an important part of Forest School and essential for all humans - no matter their age. Play helps us feel that sense of awe and wonder and gives us opportunites to play out our morals and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-communication-benefits-of-forest-school&quot;&gt;What are the communication benefits of Forest School?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest School is a great space to develop communication tools and strategies - both verbal and non-verbal. During the sessions you will likely practice communication skills involving negotiaton and cooperation. We often play games and do activities that help us thoughtfully and deliberately use verbal and non-verbal communication skills to tune into each other, listen, and communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Getting to be in nature. It’s something I love but find it can be hard to motivate myself. The group being aimed at neurodiverse adults and I like the name. (Usually) only hear of Forest School in relation to children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I have heard of Forest School for kids and always thought it would be cool to learn more about the natural world and take safe risks. I also really appreciate the opportunity to be in touch with the seasons and to be with other neurodivergent adults.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I very recently discovered I was autistic and was looking to meet people I could relate to.”&lt;/p&gt;
